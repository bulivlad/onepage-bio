I have over 5 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient backend developer and a technical lead for a full featured team, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, stream processing, and async mechanisms).
        </p>
        <p>
I love building things and Iâ€™m sort of microservices aficionado with some soft skills as well. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification. I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with architecture and project management.
